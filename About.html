                Amravati city, a regional headquarter of Amravati Division of Maharashtra state, is well known as an
                educational hub in the region, together with its social, spiritual, historical, and political
                advancements. Historical landmarks such as the Amba Devi Temple, ‘Koundinyapur’ a place from where Lord
                Krishna eloped with Rukhmini from the venue of the wedding ceremony, and Chikhaldara a lush green
                envigorating hill station in the Satpura valley. Above all, Amravati is also identified as a sacred land
                as it is the birthplace of Saints like Rashtrasant Tukdoji Maharaj and Saint Gadge Baba.
                As a recognition of the dissemination of Gadge Baba's message of cleanliness and eradication of
                superstition, the Amravati University, to which our college is affiliated, was renamed as “Sant Gadge
                Baba Amravati University, Amravati”.
                The Shri Shivaji Education Society, Amravati, was founded in 1932, by the Late Dr. Punjabrao Deshmukh, a
                leader of the peasants, the First Agriculture Minister of Independent India, and a Member of the
                “Constitution Draft Committee” for the Govt. of India. It is one of the premier institutions of higher
                education in the Central India. It is worth mentioning that, under its canopy, there are in all 289
                institutions including Medical, Agriculture, Engineering, Science, Law, Education as well as Higher
                Secondary Schools, High Schools, Middle Schools, and Primary Schools. The Shri Shivaji Education Society
                is indeed a major stakeholder in the field of education in the Vidharbha region. The society has bagged
                many prestigious awards from the state government in recognition of its dedication in the field of
                education.
                Shri Shivaji Science College, Amravati was established in 1958 with a combination of faculties namely
                Science, Arts, Commerce, Law, and Agriculture, and was separated as a Science Faculty in 1969. The
                college takes pride to declare that it has indeed grown from a seedling into a tree that has not only
                sheltered thousands of youngsters but has also molded them into great personalities now scattered across
                the globe.
                With its first accreditation in 2001 with an "A" (Four Star) grade, and reaccredited in 2008, with an
                "A"
                Grade (Very Good) with a CGPA 3.10, by NAAC. Once again NAAC has endorsed quality of this college by
                adjudging it as "A" Grade College with a CGPA 3.13 in the Third Cycle of accreditation. It was indeed a
                great achievement. The College has also earned a special reputation by being conferred with the status
                of a “College with Potential for Excellence”, by the UGC, in the first phase and now stepped up in the
                second phase of CPE. The college has also been identified by Department of Science and Technology for
                grants under FIST. Sant Gadge Baba Amravati University has also identified this college as "Lead
                College".
